/**
 * Gives the trace-contract IT its own Quarkus application instance, and therefore its own
 * [com.openbank.libs.testing.trace.RecordingSpanExporter].
 *
 * Isolation is the point, not the settings: the recorder is an application-scoped bean, so
 * without a distinct profile every other test class in this module would deposit its spans in
 * the same recorder and `hasNoErrorSpan()` would be a statement about the whole module's
 * traffic rather than about the decision under test.
 *
 * JDBC telemetry is switched on explicitly: the repository writes through plain JDBC (not
 * Hibernate), so without it there is no `UPDATE agent_proposal` span to contract against.
 *
 * Only literals here: a profile loads in a different classloader from the test class, so a
 * computed value would not be the value the application sees.
