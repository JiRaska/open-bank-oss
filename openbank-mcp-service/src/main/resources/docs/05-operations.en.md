# openbank-mcp-service — operations

## Shared build dependencies

This service's `build.gradle.kts` does not list the dependencies every Quarkus service shares: the Quarkus BOM, quarkus-kotlin, RESTEasy Reactive with Jackson, SmallRye Health and OpenAPI, OIDC, the Micrometer Prometheus registry and config-yaml, plus the quarkus-junit5, AssertJ and REST Assured test libraries. The `openbank.quarkus-service` convention plugin in `build-logic` declares them. The resolved classpath is unchanged. `build.gradle.kts` lists only what this service adds.

## account-service client

The read ports call account-service through the client generated from its `openapi.yaml` (`openbank-client-account`, ADR-0319, #13169) instead of a hand-written REST client. `AccountDirectory` reads both lookups (`GET /api/v1/accounts/iban/{iban}` and `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}`, each `@Authorize(account.read)` downstream) through the shared `AccountClient` facade. A 404 still raises a `NotFoundException`, so the tool call is denied and never answered with an empty account; any other status or a failed call is thrown unchanged. Reads stay blocking, as the previous client was. An account answer without an `id` (IBAN lookup) or without an `accountNumber` (debtor lookup for a domestic payment) is treated as malformed and fails the call.

## Test profile configuration

`application.yaml` has a `%test` section that turns off the OIDC resource server (`quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled`) and the outbound `oidc-client`, because `@QuarkusTest` classes run without Keycloak. It applies only under the test profile and does not change deployed behaviour.
